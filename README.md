Runrun's Persuasive Gordor
==========================
Because <a target="blank_" href="https://github.com/FlashYoshi/RPG">RPG</a> wasn't written as good as I thought it was I tried creating something better.
This is the result. The older version has hereby been discontinued and all work will go into this new project.

Plot (This time I actually have one)
====================================
Runrun a simple soldier in the Gurgur Kingdom. Well he doesn't really have to do anything though.
This is because the Runrun Kingdom is inhabited with Gur's. These are very lazy, though very strong, cute looking creatures.
Every Gur who lives or works at the Royal Palace has a human to help him with his tasks. So does Runrun, his human's called Gordor.
Because the Gur are very lazy by nature, this is quite the boring country, even as a soldier because noone dares to attack the way too strong Gur's.
The humans might be a sort of pet to the Gur, but that doesn't mean they've got nothing to say.
The humans have a good relationship with their owners, and they have their own reasoning. Gordor is still a lively child (aged 16).
This makes his live at the Gurgur Kingdom quite hard because it's so boring. So Gordor decides he wants to go on an adventure.
He is somehow, after a long time of persuading his master, able to convince Runrun to go on an adventure and leave the Kingdom, something no Gur ever does!

The thing I did with this plot is the change the spot of the standardized main characters around. Usually you're a strong, courageous and young knight/teenager or just a weak little babby.
But you're always accompannied by some cute (usually annoying) little "thing". So I just made the cute "thing" the main chararcter, whilst the young knight is the helper.
